# Rho plugin protocol v1

This package contains public TypeScript definitions and JSON Schemas. It has no
runtime dependency on Rho, React, a Studio singleton or a project database. The
Rust source of these definitions is the independently packageable
`rho-plugin-protocol` crate. Other languages can implement the same JSON protocol.

`schema/manifest.json`, `schema/archive.json`, `schema/rpc.json`,
`schema/window-layout.json`, `schema/scenario.json`, `schema/visual-document.json`, and the two
`schema/resource-transfer-*.json` documents define the wire shapes.
Semantic checks (identity formats, references, scope, schema compilation, digests,
limits and lifecycle) also run in the receiving owner. JSON Schema alone does not
grant authority or establish runtime availability.

`Ready.features` is an optional set of up to 16 bounded protocol-extension names.
Hosts ignore unknown names and send an optional message only when its feature was
advertised by this exact instance. `pending_cancellation_v1` supports Host-only
`PreparePendingCancellation` / `PendingCancellationPrepared`: the owner atomically
fences a still-waiting original invocation, the Host records cancellation in the
same Operation journal, then its normal Cancel signal reaches the owner. A fence
alone is neither cancellation success nor a terminal result. Lost replies and
journal failures preserve the original fence and identity for explicit retry.
The existing manifest cancellation contract does not change. See the
[backend SDK](../../crates/plugin-sdk/README.md) for owner obligations.

## Package identity

`plugin.json` declares purpose, display version, exact dependencies, required
capabilities, views, context readers and the optional native entrypoint. There is
no bundled/trusted/origin permission flag. All entrypoints live in `dist/`.
First-party source paths, dependency lockfiles and build instructions are required.
An explicit build command is an executable plus literal arguments; import never
executes it or installs a toolchain.

A `PluginRevision` hashes its parent, manifest and source inventory. A
`BuildArtifact` separately hashes its source revision, target and artifact
inventory. Display versions are labels, never binding keys. `PluginInstance`
fixes the revision, artifact, project, principal and configuration. Several
instances of the same plugin may use different revisions concurrently.

The local `.rho-plugin` archive is UTF-8 JSON with format version 1. It includes
one immutable source revision, zero or more build artifacts and content-addressed
base64 blobs. Paths are normalized relative POSIX paths, and symlinks, special
files, traversal, case collisions, undeclared blobs and digest mismatches are
rejected. Limits are 8,192 file entries and 256 MiB decoded package bytes.
Archives can be unbuilt source checkpoints; activation needs a complete artifact.

## Archive transfer ports

The view-channel `download_archive` intrinsic takes a `PluginArchiveReference`
and a plain filename, using that view's declared `plugins.archive_read@1` grant
intersected with current parent authority. Native admission validates the original
scope and byte reference; the containing browser separately checks a user gesture,
the complete bytes and live authority before requesting a download. Its response
does not prove local-file saving. Fixture preview and closure preparation refuse
this action. It creates no scientific Operation.

Ordinary plugins, connected CLI and MCP use the same `plugins.archive_*@1`
ports. `archive_stage` and `archive_discard` are Controls with `plugins.write`; `archive_import` is an
Operation with that scope. Progress, inspection, chunk reads and original receipt
queries use `plugins.read`; `archive_export` is an Operation with `plugins.read`.
Each reference binds an opaque archive ID, SHA-256 and exact encoded byte count.
Native project/principal identity supplies visibility; requests cannot select a
filesystem path, different principal or runtime resource owner.

Upload exact 65,536-byte chunks at aligned offsets, with a shorter final chunk.
Identical chunks may be retried in any order; changed content at a staged range is
rejected. `archive_progress.complete` means only that all ranges are retained.
`archive_inspect` verifies the full content digest and package contract before
returning metadata. `archive_import` revalidates and atomically installs the package
with its original transaction receipt. Neither staging nor inspection installs;
import never activates, builds or executes a package.

`ExportPluginArchive` specifies exact source and a sorted unique artifact list;
use an empty list for source only. Export fixes downloadable bytes in the scoped
transfer store and returns a `PluginArchiveReceipt`. Read at most 65,536 bytes per
`archive_read`, checking the unchanged reference, offsets and final digest.
Preparing or reading an export does not attest to a local file being saved.

The encoded archive limit is 374,691,157 bytes, with the package's separate
256 MiB decoded-content limit. Each principal may retain up to sixteen transfers
reserving twice that encoded limit; the repository allows 128 transfers reserving
eight times the limit. Upload declares and reserves its full length on the first
chunk. Explicit mutations collect expired unheld transfers after 24 hours;
queries neither renew leases nor collect bytes. Explicit `archive_discard` can
remove an unheld transfer to free capacity; it preserves package content and
original receipts and refuses accepted recovery bytes. Accepted unresolved imports and
exports keep their exact transfers and source revisions protected. Confirmed
original settlement releases protections and renews the download lease.

Persist the original request ID and arguments before invoking. After a lost reply,
inspect that Operation and `archive_receipt` with its original operation ID.
A catalog receipt is evidence of one atomic catalog transaction, not authority to
rewrite an uncertain Operation or replay it. Recover a durable original commit
through the regular Operation ports; `plugins.reconcile_references` can release
protections only after the original result is certain. Removed package content is
not reinstalled by requesting an old successful Operation again.

## Host lifecycle ports

Active Hosts expose package/lifecycle DTOs from this package through their ordinary
Query and Operation ports. `plugins.repository` identifies the store and backend
target; `plugins.list`/`plugins.inspect` describe immutable installed content.
`plugins.activate` takes `ActivatePlugin`, and `plugins.resolve` returns the exact
`ProviderBinding` used in `PluginRequest`. `plugins.release` drains that selected
instance. A stored `PluginInstanceObservation` does not establish process liveness;
check `observed_in_this_host` together with its lifecycle state. Instance pages
are scoped to the current project and original principal before pagination.

Source editing is available to ordinary plugins through `plugins.source_tree`,
`plugins.read_source`, `plugins.branches` and `plugins.check_source` queries
(`plugins.read`), and `plugins.checkpoint` Operations (`plugins.write`). The
`ListPluginSource` / `PluginSourcePage` pair pages at most 100 file identities.
`ReadPluginSource` / `PluginSourceChunk` addresses exact revision/path bytes,
returns at most 65,536 binary-safe bytes, and verifies the full stored file digest.
The read does not allow artifact paths. `PluginBranchPage` preserves unknown origins
as null rather than inventing history.

`CheckpointPlugin` contains `branch`, `expected_head` and path-keyed `changes`:
`put` (base64 bytes plus executable flag), `remove`, or `copy` (exact retained
source revision/path). Limits are 128 edits, 128 KiB of decoded inline content,
and 256 KiB for the whole request. Large retained files can be copied without inline
encoding. Complete manifest declarations, schemas, paths and visual documents must
validate; language compilation belongs to an explicit build. The pure check
returns a proposed `PluginCheckpoint` identity without installing it. Saving
atomically stores the source-only child and advances the expected branch head;
parent build artifacts stay attached to the parent. A restore creates another
child. Neither check nor save starts a provider, runs code, applies a scenario or
replays scientific effects. Ordinary request identity and original-operation
recovery rules apply to the save.

`plugins.preview@1` accepts `PreviewPlugin` and returns an ordinary
`PluginInstanceObservation` with `purpose:"fixture_preview"`. It requires
`plugins.run`, an installed source revision and an exact built artifact, an alias,
configuration and `queries`. Each `PluginPreviewQuery` supplies a declared
required/optional capability, exact arguments and fixture data. Requests are
limited to 128 fixtures and 256 KiB; duplicate matches are invalid. Preview does
not need the native target platform, activate dependencies or start a backend.
It receives no Host grants or native project path and cannot be a scenario's
runtime instance or a provider. Its query fixtures do not participate in normal
capability resolution or contract collision checks.

For normal instances and views, `purpose` is omitted and means `runtime`; normal
backend initialization retains its original protocol-v1 shape. Only fixture
instances/views carry the new marker, and they are never sent to native backends.
`plugins.instances` defaults to runtime instances only, so existing protocol-v1
readers continue receiving the original record shape. Management tools may set
`include_previews:true` to include previews; pagination and counts use that same
selected set. The repository's administrative CLI listing includes all purposes.

Open preview views with `views.open` or `windows.open_view`. The normal private
view connection carries `purpose:"fixture_preview"` in its public view record.
Query replies use the ordinary observation envelope with `source:"fixture_preview"`
and an explicit fixture notice. Unmatched queries return unavailable without
consulting the real Host. Invocations, controls, operation reads and cancellation,
original resource downloads and external links are denied. Only self `set_state`,
close cooperation and explicit text copying retain intrinsic presentation authority.
Fixtures cannot manufacture committed Operations or scientific evidence.

Preview uses the same immutable asset channel, quotas, identity/sequence checks,
revision references, acknowledged state and close protocol as runtime views.
Close its views and call `plugins.release` explicitly. A new Host does not silently
reopen or rebuild the preview; retain original Operation identities after lost
acknowledgements. A fixture instance that was never native can be explicitly
released after its historical views close, without claiming native process recovery.
Real-backend testing in a disposable project is a separate lifecycle, not an option
that elevates a fixture instance.

### External development testing

The Core protocol has no test-project lifecycle or child Host selector. A developer
tool creates a fresh project and catalog, starts an ordinary `session` or `mcp`,
imports a validated immutable package and uses the public instance and Operation
ports. The tool owns the directories and process lifetime. The Host uses its
normal project/caller scope, launcher authority, journal and native lifecycle.
Queries never create or restart a Host. New Operations retain their original
identity and uncertainty; independent projects use independent journals.

Old test-project directories and history are outside this breaking upgrade's
contract. There is no compatibility selector, migration or historical child
journal service. SDK and product consumer integration are separate owner tasks.

`plugins.project_coverage@1` and `operation.project_coverage@1` accept
`ProjectReadCoverageArguments` (`{}`) and return `ProjectReadCoverage` in the query
envelope's `data`. They require `project.references.read` together with
`plugins.read` or `operation.read`, respectively, through the same declared grants
as other Host queries. The only field, `all_visible`, reports whether every
recorded instance or operation in the Host's project is visible to the original
principal. Failed and released instances still count. No foreign identity,
configuration, content or count is returned. An unavailable response or
`all_visible:false` means scoped pages cannot establish complete coverage. This
metadata neither freezes records nor proves that a native resource is unused;
owners must separately inspect their references and native preconditions.

`manifest.requires` declares mandatory capability grants. `optional_requires`
declares capabilities that an activation may explicitly select using
`ActivatePlugin.optional_capabilities`. Omitting the selection grants none of
those optional capabilities, even if their providers are available. Selected
versions and scopes must match this exact revision; Host admission checks every
selected handler and the original caller's authority. Unknown, repeated,
unavailable or unauthorized selections fail before activation. Configuration,
opening a view and later provider installation cannot change these frozen grants.
A view receives its instance's selected grants only when its opening caller can
delegate all of them; each subsequent call still intersects current parent scopes.

`host.core_contract@1` accepts `HostCapabilityArguments` with an exact capability
key and returns `HostCapabilityContract` in the ordinary query envelope. Declare
`plugins.read` to inspect the native Host port's project, kind, description, input
schema and required scopes. Metadata inspection does not grant execution scopes,
start a provider or create an Operation. Missing ports and dynamically contributed
plugin capabilities are refused. Inspect contributed capabilities through their
immutable package manifest and retain their exact `ProviderBinding`; a plugin
cannot become a native port by choosing a similar name or domain.

The recovery CLI and active Host use `plugins-v1` beside the configured database,
with an explicit CLI `--store` override. Importing or observing a revision never
activates it. Lifecycle operations use stable caller request identities and the
same authoritative Operation journal as contributed capabilities. The official
MCP connection updates its tool catalog after provider publication or failure;
page cursors cannot cross changed catalogs. The UI SDK remains separate from
these public type definitions.

`workspace.paths@1` takes `{}` and returns `WorkspacePaths` under `project.read`.
The Host supplies its normalized project root and protected storage boundaries;
neither arguments nor plugin configuration can supply those paths. A native
backend declares this requirement and uses a reverse `HostCall` with an active
parent that holds the scope. The reply is the ordinary Host query envelope, with
the paths in `data`. Preserve lexical paths and resolved aliases, including
nonexistent sidecars. Limits are 256 paths, 4096 UTF-8 bytes per path and 128 KiB
for the encoded path list. This query neither scans files nor starts a runtime,
and does not extend the initialization message or provide an OS sandbox.

`windows.layout@1` accepts `PluginWindowArguments` and observes a
`PluginWindowLayout`. `windows.update_layout@1` accepts `UpdatePluginWindowLayout`
through the ordinary Operation port with `plugins.run`. It saves the arrangement
using the window's `expected_version`; it does not open, close or move ownership of
views. Project and principal come from the Host. Every referenced view must belong
to that exact window and scope, and a view caller cannot address another window.
Closed views can remain explicit placeholders without live connections or an
installed artifact. Reads never reconstruct them or mutate their saved state.

Layout nodes are empty regions, weighted splits and selected tab groups. IDs are
unique across groups and views. Limits are 256 view references, 1024 structural
nodes, depth 32 and a 256 KiB update payload. Split weights must be positive and
finite, including their sum. A layout version is a presentation precondition for
one window, not a scientific revision.

`windows.open_view@1` accepts `OpenPluginWindowView` through the same Operation
port and returns `OpenedPluginWindowView`: a public view record and the newly saved
layout. `view` selects an exact active instance, contribution, configuration and
state. `expected_layout_version` fences the placement; `group` names an existing
tab group. A null group creates the first tab group only in an empty window.
Creation, the revision reference and selection commit in one transaction; a stale
version, missing group or invalid view leaves them unchanged. The new connection
is published only after commit. Repeating the original request returns its original
Operation, without a second view. Scenario preparation/application remains separate.

## Runtime protocol

Each control message is one UTF-8 JSON `RpcFrame` of at most 1 MiB. A connection
has a Host-issued identity and an independent monotonically increasing sequence
in each direction, starting at one. Messages bind an instance and request. A
reconnected process receives a new connection identity; old messages are stale.
Stdout is reserved for control frames, stderr for logs. Large bytes travel through
bounded owner-scoped `ResourceReference` reads, never inline control payloads.

Initialization must finish before contributions become visible. A process may
return a proposed `PluginCommitPlan`; only the core Operation owner may validate
and commit it. Accepted calls retain their exact provider and native target.
An unavailable process, closed connection or cancellation acknowledgement with
`confirmed:false` cannot mean success or confirmed cancellation. Reconnection
does not authorize replay. Reverse calls require the delegated instance grants.

Each capability declares 1–16 valid scientific input `examples` for discovery.
Host callers submit `PluginRequest`: `binding`, `arguments`, and owner-defined
`preconditions`. A binding names the capability version, exact instance/revision/
artifact, project and optional native target. The Host derives the authenticated
principal and scopes; a backend cannot supply or expand them.

An operation may name a same-package query as `preflight`. That query receives
`PluginPreflightRequest` and must return a complete `PluginPreflightResult` with
normalized arguments, native target and owner qualification. It must not start
work or perform effects. A supplied target cannot be changed by preflight. The
Host freezes the result before Operation admission and sends the qualification
as `PluginCall.owner_context` along with the original Operation ID. Queries carry
no Operation ID. Duplicate original requests read their saved record without
running preflight again.

`kind: "control"` contributes a transient handler for an existing owner request.
Use `Control` / `ControlResult` frames with no new `operation_id`; Host callers
use the same `PluginRequest` binding envelope through the Control port. Native
request/answer identities and preconditions remain owner-defined. The Host limits
arguments/results to 256 KiB, redacts validation/native errors, and creates no
Operation, receipt, event, recovery candidate or resource-transfer parent. Only
explicitly selected queries and controls can reach a draining instance. Read the
pending native request after an unacknowledged answer; never replay automatically.

After the original journal reaches a terminal state, the Host sends
`OperationSettled(OperationSettlement)` to that exact native instance. The payload
contains only the original ID, binding and terminal outcome, not inputs or result
bytes. The owner applies matching scheduling cleanup idempotently and echoes the
exact payload as `SettlementAcknowledged`. Neither public Control nor reverse
`HostCall` exposes this notification. It has no resource-transfer parent. Never
advance the next queue item merely because a native CommitPlan was returned.
The Host preserves the protecting operation reference until acknowledgement;
lost acknowledgement cannot alter the committed scientific result. Explicit
`plugins.reconcile_references` uses original journal proof to resend an unanswered
settlement, with its original request identity and a fresh ordered frame sequence.
An exact late duplicate acknowledgement is accepted within the bounded 128-request
transport history. Unrelated identities and unsolicited replies fence the instance.

The core bridge wraps native recovery as `plugin_owner_recovery`; transport and
contract failures retain their original candidate under a distinct boundary
recovery. Proposed resource evidence is accepted only after the resource owner
verifies its identity, visibility and digest. Active Hosts compose this resource
owner; a standalone bridge with `NoPluginResources` deliberately rejects evidence.
No verifier fetches arbitrary remote data to satisfy a plugin's claim.

The optional initialization `resource_channel` is an ephemeral per-instance Unix
socket and credential. Data headers are BE u32 lengths plus at most 16 KiB JSON;
`ResourceTransferRequest` and `ResourceTransferResponse` define the language-neutral
protocol. Raw upload/read bytes use this separate socket, not control/stdout.
Uploads inherit the active parent's exact instance/project/principal, verify the
declared length and SHA-256, and become visible only after complete atomic retention.
A query may retain observation bytes without committing scientific facts. Backend
channels read only their own instance's resources; cross-owner reads require a
granted Host query. See the public [backend SDK](../../crates/plugin-sdk/README.md)
for framing and streaming examples.

`resources.list` takes `ResourceList` and returns a scoped `ResourcePage`;
`resources.inspect` takes `ResourceInspect` and verifies the full reference;
`resources.read` takes `ResourceRead` and returns `ResourceChunk`. Host queries
require `resources.read` plus original project/principal visibility, even after
a provider is released. Read offsets and cursors count bytes, not characters.
Limits are 256 MiB per upload, 256 KiB per read, four concurrent transfers per Host,
512 MiB retained per instance and 2 GiB / 16,384 entries per store. A failed or
partial upload is not evidence; lost acknowledgement does not delete complete
retained bytes. Identical uploads resolve to the same immutable resource identity.

UI views use isolated iframes and an instance-bound message channel. Current
messages cover queries, controls, invocations, original-operation reads and view
state; resources use the declared Query port. Theme, menu, focus and shortcut
integration must also use public services as those contributions are implemented.
Views never receive the Host's general credential or parent DOM access.
Private `views.connection` material remains with the containing Host shell;
plugin callers cannot query it, even with a declared grant. `views.inspect`
provides the public record, configuration and state without connection credentials.
`views.caller@1` takes an empty object under `plugins.read` and returns
`PluginViewCaller` (`schema/view-caller.json`). Its optional `view` contains the
original native view, window and connection IDs, including across backend calls.
Only a caller admitted without a view returns `null`. A closed, closing, missing
or replaced calling view fails instead of falling back to another identity.
The query accepts no selector, opens nothing and returns no call or asset token.
This observation cannot authorize a later request or prove continuing liveness;
owners must revalidate their original controller when admitting later writes.
Native backends and build scripts are
trusted local code: this is UI, failure and lifetime isolation, not an OS sandbox.

## Scenarios and visual source

Scenarios pin instance aliases, dependencies, configuration, layouts and unique
default providers. A window selects its own scenario; switching does not end
analysis processes. View state carries the revision that authored its schema.
Opening defaults under another revision is explicit; old state is retained.

`VisualDocument` stores a node map with stable identities. Containers, splits,
tabs, text, buttons, forms, lists, tables, media and custom components share this
structure. Data bindings use property paths without `eval`. Operations are only
event actions; render/mount is not an allowed action trigger. Custom source is
referenced by path, never reverse-engineered from the rendered tree. A data-source
capability must additionally resolve to a query when the document is mounted.

Checkpoint configuration uses public values and credential references. Actual
credential bytes remain with the credential owner, outside revision and scenario
storage. History is not a rollback mechanism for scientific effects or R memory.

`scenarios.list@1` returns up to 100 `ScenarioSummary` values with an exclusive
scenario-identity cursor. `scenarios.get@1` reads one exact `ScenarioRevision`;
follow its parent for history. Both use `plugins.read` and the authenticated project
and principal. They do not initialize a provider or change a window.

`scenarios.checkpoint@1` accepts `SaveScenario` under `plugins.write`. A null
`expected_head` creates a named scenario; an existing head must match exactly.
The owner computes the content identity and commits the immutable checkpoint, new
head and all package protections together. Earlier checkpoints keep their references.
Restoring a previous composition means saving it against the current head, creating
another child. Retain the original request identity after a lost acknowledgement.

Save validates structural bounds (256 KiB, 256 instances, 512 providers and 1024
layout nodes including views) without claiming the referenced artifacts are available.
Missing packages remain explicit references and become protected if imported later.
The per-instance `optional_capabilities` selection is retained without conferring
activation authority.

`scenarios.prepare@1` and `scenarios.apply@1` both accept `ApplyScenario` under
`plugins.run`. The caller explicitly prepares instances with `plugins.activate`
and views with `views.open` before applying. Supply every scenario alias as an exact
`InstanceRef`, and every reusable view definition id as its prepared live view id.
Preparation does not reserve, activate or change anything. It checks the expected
window layout version, exact artifacts/configuration, manifest dependency aliases,
frozen optional grants, caller authority, view schemas, resource context and live
readiness. Apply repeats these checks and commits layout plus selection in one
transaction. Failure leaves the former window composition intact. Preparation
resources remain inspectable through normal instance/view ports; apply never
releases them or cancels scientific work.

Reuse is explicit. The chosen live view must have the same owner, contribution,
configuration and resource context and belong to this window. Its current state
and unsynchronized content are retained, even when different from the checkpoint.
To open the checkpoint's saved state, explicitly create a new view with that state.
Hiding a former view does not close its channel or backend. `OpenPluginView.resource`
is optional immutable context and is present in the public record/bootstrap when
supplied. Its media type must be declared by the contribution and its retained
identity must match this project/principal. Qualification reads bounded metadata;
resource byte reads still require the separate resource grant and verify bytes.

`windows.scenario@1` returns `WindowScenarioSnapshot`: selection and current layout
observed together. `applied_layout_version` identifies the initial application;
later docking edits may advance the layout version. Retained selection does not
attest to runtime readiness after disconnect. `windows.resolve@1` accepts
`ResolveWindowProvider` and resolves only the exact selected default, including
its target. Both use `plugins.run` and preserve caller/project/window restrictions.
There is no fallback to another active revision. New interactions may resolve the
current selection; existing documents and accepted work retain their original
explicit bindings. Apply uses the shared Operation idempotency contract: after a
lost acknowledgement inspect the original operation, rather than retrying under
a new request identity.

Regenerate these artifacts from Rho-core with `node scripts/generate.mjs`.

## Document draft content

`DocumentDraft`, `StageDraftChunk`, `SaveDocumentDraft`, `ReadDocumentDraft` and
`DiscardDocumentDraft` describe generic synchronized bytes exposed by the shared
`documents.inspect/read/stage/save/discard` Host ports. The UI SDK stages and
verifies this content without interpreting it. Draft metadata is opaque, and a
version is not evidence of a file save or run.

`documents.list@1` accepts `ListDocumentDrafts` and returns `DocumentDraftPage`.
It enumerates at most 20 non-discarded summaries in an explicit window under the
authenticated project and principal. An optional exact source filter selects the
encoding revision and contribution. A summary includes identity, version, digest,
byte count and bounded metadata; content and its chunk map are read separately.
The exclusive identity cursor remains valid after that identity is discarded.
Each page observes current state, so callers must inspect and read at the returned
version; enumeration does not freeze all pages or attest to unsynchronized edits.
Plugin views retain their original-window fence and current parent scopes. A
closing view is restricted to its own source; listing is not a persistence
exception for inactive instances. Reads never start providers or collect leases.

An upload identifies one captured save attempt. Its chunks are canonical 64 KiB
byte slices, except for the last slice, with per-chunk and full-content SHA-256.
Staging is bounded and expires when unreferenced; only an atomic save publishes
the new content and expected document version. A draft retains its exact source
revision and contribution independently of a live view. Reads require the current
version, return bounded base64 bytes and preserve Unicode by avoiding character
offsets. A changed version fails instead of following the latest text. Discard
retains an identity tombstone but releases content and the revision reference.

Public types are emitted as `.d.ts` declarations with ESM `.js` specifiers. They
contain no runtime implementation and do not force a consumer to widen its
TypeScript source root. The external conformance check pins a separate `rootDir`.

## Contributed context

The four `schema/context-search.json`, `schema/context-page.json`,
`schema/preview-context.json` and `schema/context-preview.json` files are standalone
contracts for contributed queries.

`ContextSearch` / `ContextPage` and `PreviewContext` / `ContextPreview` describe
bounded read-only discovery and preview. A `ContextContribution` declares its own
search and preview queries; consumers resolve the exact active provider. A
`ContextReference` retains that provider, contribution and an opaque
owner-defined selector; it names no window. Project, caller and authority come
from the trusted call context, and a view caller's window restriction stays in
the Host-held call scope. The owner must revalidate the selector's native
identity/version before preview; references grant no scope and do not retain bytes.
Page cursors are owner-defined, with at most 20 items per response. Preview text
is plain text bounded to 64 KiB, with explicit truncation, bounded presentation
data and at most eight resource references. Scientific inclusion choices and
source freshness remain owner semantics. A read must not activate a provider,
flush an editor, recover work or perform scientific writes.
