# Rho UI SDK

A framework-independent browser client for an ordinary plugin's isolated view.
Compile `index.ts` with the public `@rho/plugin-protocol` declarations beside it
(the sibling `plugin-protocol` package). Ship every emitted JavaScript module,
including `resources.js`, with the plugin's source and immutable `dist/` artifact.
There are no third-party runtime imports. No private Studio, scientific module, framework or Host bearer is needed.

```ts
import { connectPluginView } from "@rho/plugin-ui";
const client = await connectPluginView();
const savedState = client.view.state;
const snapshot = await client.query({ id: "example.read", version: 1 }, {});
await client.setState({ selected: "sample-1" });
const accepted = await client.invoke({ id: "example.run", version: 1 }, {}, {
  requestId: "stable-user-action-id",
});
// Keep the returned original Operation identity and inspect it with operation().
// A cancellation request or a disconnected iframe does not confirm native stop.
```

Declare mandatory external capabilities and scopes in `manifest.requires`.
Optional features use `manifest.optional_requires` and an explicit selection in
the instance's activation request. An unselected declaration creates no grant,
even when the capability is available. The original caller must already possess
the selected authority. Query and invocation results
retain their shared Host envelopes. Capability payloads and native preconditions
come from their public owner contracts. Invocation returns after admission; its
accepted record may still be running. `operation(id)` and `cancel(id)` address only
operations started by this view, under the original principal and granted scopes.
Self-state saving is an intrinsic view operation with a version comparison. It
cannot name another view, change configuration or acquire another capability.

Use `control(capability, arguments)` for transient answers to an existing native
request, with the exact provider and request identities required by its owner.
This uses the same declared grants as queries and Operations, but creates no
Operation or saved answer. Do not put passwords or other transient answers in view
state. A missing acknowledgement requires inspection of the pending native request;
it does not authorize automatic retry. Control errors redact native payloads.

`ViewRequestError.diagnostic` retains the original structured Host diagnostic,
including recovery material; an error string does not replace that evidence.

For `.rho-plugin` bytes, use `capturePluginArchive(blob, archiveId)` to bind an
immutable Blob, opaque identity, full SHA-256 and length. Persist the returned
reference before `stagePluginArchive(client, capture, { signal, progress })`.
Staging uses only the declared `plugins.archive_stage@1` / `plugins.write` grant,
verifies the capture and every bounded acknowledgement, and can repeat identical
chunks after an interrupted upload. Retain/reselect the exact file to resume;
never put the full Blob into a small view-state record. Completion means staged
bytes, not validated package content or an installed revision.

`readPluginArchive(client, reference, { maxBytes, signal })` requires
`plugins.archive_read@1` / `plugins.read`. It verifies the exact reference, every
64 KiB page and final checksum, using the package archive limit (374,691,157 bytes),
independently of the smaller media-view limit. Both helpers stop further transfer
on abort without discarding bytes or cancelling accepted work. Neither helper
invokes import/export, activates code, triggers a browser download or claims a
saved file. Use the separate explicit archive ports for inspection, import,
export and safe discard, with normal original-Operation recovery. Ship the emitted
`archives.js` alongside the other public SDK modules.

For opaque document content larger than view state, use `captureDraftContent(bytes)`
to freeze and hash the current bytes, then
`stageDraftContent(client, { draft, upload }, capture)` with an explicit
`documents.stage@1` / `documents.write` grant. Every capture needs its own upload
identity. Staging verifies the entire capture before sending bounded 64 KiB chunks,
and verifies each acknowledgement. It returns the content manifest; it does not
publish the draft or invoke an Operation. Content is limited to 8 MiB. The plugin
owns its encoding and any smaller editing limit.

Publish explicitly through `documents.save@1` under `documents.write`, supplying
the draft/window, upload identity, source revision/contribution, expected document
version (or null for a new identity), returned content manifest and at most 32 KiB
of metadata. Retain the original invocation identity and arguments in synchronized
view state before invoking. Admission is not a saved-draft acknowledgement: inspect
the original Operation until its outcome is established. Keep pending captures
separate from later edits, and never replace an uncertain request with a new ID.
Staging and read helpers accept an AbortSignal; interruption stops further transfer
without cancelling accepted work or claiming rollback.

A close handler may stage and invoke `documents.save@1`, wait for the original
save to succeed, and persist its draft ID/version through `setState` before
returning. These exact two mutation ports are allowed during close preparation;
discard, other capability versions and unrelated actions remain fenced. The Host
still requires declared grants and parent authority, and restricts closing or
inactive views to their own exact encoding revision/contribution and window.
All renderers must finish before closure; once their state is sealed, new staging
or saves are refused. An existing view may finish its own draft synchronization
while its instance is draining. Completing instance release still requires closing
its views, and does not cancel their accepted work.

`readDraft(client, record, { maxBytes, signal })` requires explicit
`documents.inspect@1` and `documents.read@1` grants under `documents.read`. It checks
the record against the view's project, principal and window, observes its exact
current version, and verifies bounded read ranges, every chunk and the complete
digest. It refuses a changed version, discarded content or corrupt/incomplete bytes
instead of returning newer content. Even empty content crosses authorized reads.
This is synchronized current content, not historical execution evidence or a
filesystem-save receipt. Ship the emitted `drafts.js` with the other SDK modules.

`client.view.purpose === "fixture_preview"`
identifies an executable fixture preview; the containing shell also labels it
outside the iframe. Queries use only explicitly supplied fixture data and never
fall through to real project reads. Invocations, controls, operation access,
resource downloads and external links are disabled. Self `setState`, close
cooperation and explicit `copyText` retain their normal presentation behavior.
Preview creates no backend process or provider registration. It does not emulate
successful scientific Operations. Use explicit disposable-project testing for a
real backend.

`client.testProject(id)` selects one existing disposable child for `query`,
`control`, `invoke`, `operation` and `cancel`. It requires container feature
`test_projects_v1` and an active runtime view declaring `plugins.test_project@1`
with `plugins.read` and `plugins.run`. Actual capability calls still require their
own declared grants, intersected with the parent authority. The selector never
adds its management scopes to those grants. Fixture previews cannot select children.
Missing or stopped targets refuse calls rather than falling back to analysis.

The selection is immutable on each facade. Invocation request IDs and view identity
are preserved in the child's original journal. Intrinsic state, close cooperation,
copy and resource presentation stay bound to the original view; they cannot select
a child. Selected draft writes are fenced while that original view is closing.
`client.openTestWorkspace(id)` requests a new same-Host workspace from a focused
explicit gesture. The shell validates the live child and constructs the private
URL; the SDK sees only a navigation-request acknowledgement, not credentials or
proof that the destination loaded. Child creation and view opening remain separate
ordinary native operations. The facade exposes no lifecycle automation.

The container creates one opaque-origin iframe and transfers one private
MessagePort to that exact document. The SDK checks the parent, document nonce,
connection/view identity, request correlation, ordering and a 1 MiB message quota.
A readiness handshake permits ES modules to await connection at top level without
waiting for the document load event.
At most 128 calls may be pending. The Host orders message acceptance but permits
concurrent completion, so a slow query does not hold up a later control or state
save. Await dependent operations explicitly; state saves are serialized by the
SDK. A missing preceding transport message has a bounded 10-second wait. An unacknowledged response times out after 30
seconds without claiming that an accepted Operation stopped. Oversized scientific
results should use bounded resource reads. Dispose the client on document teardown;
disposal closes the channel and rejects local waiters without cancelling Operations.

The containing shell keeps the call credential. Asset URLs contain only a separate,
view-scoped credential for the exact immutable artifact. Source files, parent DOM,
parent storage, generic Host credentials and unrestricted API access are absent
from the iframe channel. The iframe allows scripts but not same-origin privilege,
forms, popups, downloads or top-level navigation. Asset responses also sandbox
direct navigation and restrict subresource loads; this is not an OS sandbox or a
claim that browser self-navigation cannot issue a network request. A subsequent
frame navigation fences the container. Direct clipboard APIs remain denied;
ordinary editable text and browser keyboard copy/paste remain browser behavior.

For a Copy button, use `await client.copyText(text)` or
`await client.copyText(async () => collectBoundedText())` from its explicit action
handler. The `text_copy_v1` container feature reserves a native write while the
focused view has a current user gesture, then calls the producer. This permits
asynchronous object/text reads before any clipboard content is published. The
producer must preserve its original observations and copy budget. If collection
fails, the reservation is released without supplying clipboard data. The SDK
reports success only after the browser confirms the write. Missing features,
permission refusal, expired reservations and uncertain completion are errors.

One copy reservation per view expires after 60 seconds without submission. The
existing 1 MiB serialized-message quota still applies, including JSON escaping and
envelope bytes. Closure releases unsubmitted data; a submitted or timed-out native
write is never described as rolled back. Host validation checks the live view,
window, principal, sequence and parent's existing `plugins.run` authority, and
creates no Operation or retained text. It acknowledges identity only; a standalone
Host request cannot claim to have changed the browser clipboard. Clipboard reading
is not exposed by this API.

The container uses a promised `text/plain` Blob through
[ClipboardItem](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ClipboardItem/ClipboardItem),
with the browser's [user activation](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#tracking-user-activation)
and clipboard permissions. This is browser presentation cooperation, not an
operating-system sandbox guarantee.

For an explicit documentation or project link, call
`await client.openExternal(url)` from the user's action handler. The
`external_links_v1` feature accepts bounded absolute HTTP(S) URLs without embedded
credentials, whitespace or backslashes. The containing browser independently
validates the destination, current focused-frame gesture and Host acknowledgement
before requesting a fresh tab. It severs the opener and suppresses the referrer;
neither the private Workbench address nor Host credentials are forwarded.
The acknowledgement means navigation was requested, not that the remote page
loaded. A blocked popup, missing gesture/feature or uncertain reply is an error.
The Host validates only view authority and does not open a browser, persist the
URL or create an Operation. Closure fences this action with other new work.

The container uses a fresh blank [Window.open](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/open)
handle and a [no-referrer link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Referrer-Policy)
so a blocked tab can be distinguished from a requested navigation. It never
targets an existing named browsing context.

For an explicit original-file export, call
`await client.downloadResource(reference, filename)` from the user's action
handler. Declare `resources.read@1` with the `resources.read` scope. The
`resource_download_v1` feature captures that exact retained reference and a plain
filename (up to 240 UTF-8 bytes, without paths or control characters). Resources
are limited to 16 MiB. The containing browser checks the focused-frame gesture,
reads bounded chunks through the same view grant, verifies every identity/range
and the complete SHA-256, then rechecks live Host authority before requesting
the download. One download may be collected per view at a time.

For a prepared package export, call `client.downloadArchive(reference, filename)`
from a separate explicit Download action. It requires `archive_download_v1` and
the declared `plugins.archive_read@1` / `plugins.read` grant. Package references
retain their own archive bound and never impersonate runtime resources. The
container reads 64 KiB pages with `readPluginArchive`, verifies the full checksum,
then rechecks original authority before requesting the browser download. Archives
and resources share the same per-view active-download slot. Archive collection
stops after nine minutes; the SDK allows ten minutes for its response, while other
requests retain their existing timeout. A late read cannot initiate a timed-out
transfer. Intrinsic downloads cannot select a disposable child project.

The acknowledgement means the browser download was requested; it does not claim
that a file was saved. Browser settings, cancellation and disk failures remain
outside this acknowledgement. Missing features, invalid references, failed reads,
revoked authority and closure before submission are errors. The Host only
authorizes the original read: it writes no file, starts no runtime and creates no
Operation. Disposal stops unsubmitted collection, but cannot roll back a browser
download already requested. The opaque iframe itself gains no download permission.

`views.open`, `views.update` and `views.close` use the common Operation port.
Install the document's close handler after constructing its presentation model:

```ts
const closing = await client.installCloseHandler({
  async flush() {
    pausePresentationUpdates();
    await finishLocalCapture();
    await client.setState(captureCurrentDraft());
  },
  resume() { resumePresentationUpdates(); },
});
closing.subscribe(() => showCloseStatus(closing.getSnapshot()));
```

The container advertises `view_close_v1`. The SDK registers a document identity
and makes bounded lifecycle observations. `views.close` defaults to `flush`: the
owner fences new actions, requests every registered document's final state, and
waits up to 15 seconds for acknowledgements of one exact version. The SDK makes
its own document inert during preparation, awaits the handler and queued state
writes, and acknowledges the original close Operation. It refuses preparation
while composing text without making that editor inert. A refusal or deadline
leaves the view open; the handler's `resume` restores presentation updates.
Handlers must drain local capture/acceptance tasks and pause background changes,
but must not wait for scientific execution or cancel accepted work. A failed
save must reject. Keep transient/password answers out of retained view state.
Objects flushes presentation choices, Console flushes its draft and refuses an
unsent transient answer, and Viewer saves selection/history/follow choices. This
does not serialize arbitrary nested HTML widgets.

Successful closure removes the exact tab and releases its view reference in one
transaction with closure of the acknowledged record. A lost reply is unconfirmed;
the container must inspect the original Operation before removing the iframe.
Disposal, navigation and browser reload do not prove that the destroyed document
saved its local buffer. The containing shell assigns a private native identity to
each document's SDK handler and retires that exact registration through
`views.release_renderer` after destruction. This transient Control carries the
original private view credential, never enters the iframe or Operation journal,
and never attests to saved state. Destruction during preparation refuses that
close; cached and hidden documents stay registered. Lost registration or release
acknowledgements remain uncertain. For an unavailable document, explicitly inspect `views.inspect` and
invoke `views.close` with `mode: { kind: "retain_acknowledged", expected_version }`.
This recovery mode retains that exact acknowledged state and does not claim to
have saved disconnected edits. Never automatically fall back to it after failure.
Host shutdown similarly retains acknowledged state and layout placeholders; it
does not claim a close-time flush.

For navigation into a window, declare `windows.layout` and `windows.open_view`
with `plugins.run`, observe the containing window, then invoke `windows.open_view`
with its expected layout version and an explicit target group. That operation
creates the view and selects it atomically. It returns public records only;
connection credentials remain in the containing shell. Keep the original request
ID and arguments after a lost acknowledgement. A view cannot open another window.
The opening capability grant must also declare the scopes needed by the target
view: new views cannot inherit authority excluded from the opening call. This
is explicit delegation within the caller's existing scopes.
`views.inspect` reads durable state; `views.connection` observes an already-open
connection without recreating it. Open views protect their revision. Closing one
revokes both credentials and releases only its view reference. It leaves the
backend instance and already-accepted scientific work intact. Host restart does
not reconnect a stored view. Open a fresh view with the retained state and exact
revision, and explicitly close obsolete records. There is no state migration.

Run `node scripts/test-plugin-ui.mjs` from a checkout to verify external strict
NodeNext compilation and the public channel. The browser conformance fixture is
built entirely outside the checkout from the public SDK, then snapshotted and
activated through the ordinary package and Host lifecycle paths.

`readResource(client, reference, {maxBytes, signal})` reads through the declared
`resources.read@1` capability. It validates each returned reference, offset and
length, then verifies the complete SHA-256 before returning bytes. Reads are
256 KiB or smaller; presentation defaults to 16 MiB. Aborting stops further reads
without cancelling the producing Operation. Empty resources still require an
authorized query. A mismatch preserves the original reference and throws an error.

A plugin may present saved HTML in another iframe using `srcdoc`,
`sandbox="allow-scripts"` and `referrerpolicy="no-referrer"`. Inherited CSP and
sandbox flags preserve opaque origins. The existing `frame-src 'none'` blocks
URL-backed frames; it does not prevent a local inline source document. No core
security-policy change is needed. Network connections, workers, forms, top
navigation and parent DOM access remain unavailable. Do not insert resource HTML
into the plugin's own DOM. Remove the nested document when replacing or closing
it. This is saved content presentation, not a live-service or scientific execution
capability. Rendering and JavaScript behavior still require real-browser
verification; a load event does not establish content correctness.

Host journal request IDs are scoped to the originating view. Use
`operationRequestId(originalView, originalRequest)` for a receipt comparison or
`operation.list_recent` request filter. Pass the unchanged original request to
`invoke`; a reopened view may inspect the old request but must not replay it under
a new caller identity.

`inspectOriginalOperation(client, savedIntent)` finds the single original record
through `operation.list_recent` when the acknowledgement was lost, or uses the
saved operation ID when one is known. `verifyOriginalOperation` checks the
original view, scoped request ID, capability, normalized arguments, preconditions
and status before a consumer trusts the record. Persist the intent before
dispatch, including the complete native target that admission will record. For
Files, observe `workspace.paths` and use its `project_root` as the binding target;
an unspecified target may be filled by Files preflight and will fail exact
original-argument comparison. Consumers own their intent, UI and decision to
recover; these helpers never invoke or replay an operation.

### Visual declarations

`createPollingVisualSubscription(client, {intervalMs})` is an optional adapter for
declarations with `subscribe: true` when a provider exposes snapshot queries but
no event stream. It captures the source's capability and arguments, bounds the
adapter to eight concurrent reads, and stops delivering results after disposal.
The first read comes from the renderer; later reads occur at the configured
interval. The adapter does not make a query into a native push subscription or
persist scientific actions.

`parseVisualDocument(text)` validates the public `VisualDocument` format without
DOM access or Host calls. `createVisualNode` and `visualNodeKinds` cover the ten
node kinds; `visualBindingValue` and `visualConditionMatches` evaluate captured
query/fixture values with own-property paths and structural JSON equality.
`validateVisualSourcePath` checks declared custom-component source paths.
Studio uses these same exports for its editing diagnostics and fixture canvas.
Native package validation remains authoritative for checkpoints.

`mountVisualDocument(container, declaration, options)` executes the same model
inside an ordinary plugin document. It validates before mounting and owns only
its initially empty container. Keep the returned handle: `ready` reports initial
read outcomes, `refresh(source)` performs another read, and `dispose()` removes
the view, observation subscriptions, custom instances and resource URLs. Disposal
does not cancel accepted scientific work. Reads have an eight-request concurrency
limit; stale query replies cannot overwrite a newer query or observation.

Supply `reader: client` for public SDK queries and verified resource reads. Bound
paths address the **whole query response**, including `data` when the capability
returns a snapshot envelope. A source with `subscribe: true` requires an explicit
provider observation adapter returning synchronous cleanup. The runtime does not
invent a generic native subscription port or silently substitute polling. An
adapter must preserve the source's exact provider/session and observation semantics.

The first component conventions are:

| Node | Properties / behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Container / split | Children in a column / row; container `direction: "row"` selects a row |
| Tabs | One panel per child; child `label` names the tab; arrow keys select tabs |
| Text / button | `text` or `label`; button `disabled` |
| Form | Static `fields` with `name`, `label`, `value`, optional `required` and `type: "number"`; `submit_label`; refresh preserves typed values and focus |
| List | Bound `items`; selection carries `{index, item}`; object items may have `label` |
| Table | Bound `items` and string `columns`; first cell is the row selection button |
| Media | `resource` is an exact PNG/JPEG ResourceReference, verified before display; `alt` supplies alternative text |
| Custom | A compiled registration matching the declared `source` and `export`, with `mount`, `update(properties)` and `dispose` |

Lists/tables present at most 1,000 rows and 64 columns; forms accept at most 128
fields. They are bounded presentations, not general spreadsheet/form editors.
A binding replaces the corresponding property after a value is observed.
Custom code is opaque and precompiled by the plugin's build; the runtime does not
evaluate arbitrary declaration strings or import source paths dynamically. A React
adapter can implement the same mount/update/dispose contract. The declared custom
schemas describe its public contract; the custom implementation owns schema-aware
input/output handling. Style token keys (`gap`, `padding`, `color`, `background`,
`font_size`, `border_radius`) resolve names through the supplied compiled `tokens`
map. Declaration strings are never injected as CSS or HTML.

Only trusted browser gestures dispatch declared events. `refresh` performs a
public read. Supply `action(action, context)` for `invoke`, `open_view` and
`set_state`; the adapter must use the public SDK, preserve the original caller,
persist exact write intent before dispatch, and retain uncertain receipts for
explicit inspection. The renderer supplies a unique request ID for each action
in that gesture, the captured source values and form/selection value. Arguments
remain literal declaration JSON; no expression evaluation or implicit interpolation
occurs. A pending action suppresses additional gestures; a failure stops the
remaining action sequence and is displayed. The runtime does not journal, retry,
replay, route or claim success for Operations. The adapter remains responsible for
recovery before accepting another write. Do not use render/update callbacks to
start scientific work.

For a minimal ordinary package, `scripts/fixtures/visual-plugin.mjs` builds an
independent example from this public SDK. Its recipe validates `views/report.json`
and emits that exact declaration into the built view. The example uses public
catalog queries and intrinsic view-state actions only. `visual-studio.spec.ts`
checks declaration edit → checkpoint → build → fixture preview → applied view;
`visual-runtime.spec.ts` checks component behavior and lifecycle with controlled
read/action peers. These checks do not establish every provider's subscription or
scientific Operation recovery behavior. The Studio editing canvas remains inert.
